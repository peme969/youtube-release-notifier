# Feature 

- XP farm ‚ö°Ô∏è
- Streak keeper üî•

# Usage 

  1. Go to [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com) and log in to your Duolingo account
  2. Open the browser's console by pressing `F12` button ( or `Fn+F12` on some laptops )
  3. Click on the tab `Console` then paste this to the console

```
document.cookie
  .split(';')
  .find(cookie => cookie.includes('jwt_token'))
  .split('=')[1]
```
  4. Copy the token without `'` ( example: 'abcde1234` -> abcde1234 )
  5. [Fork this repository üç¥](https://github.com/gorouflex/DuoXPy/fork)
  6. Go to your forked repository üç¥
  7. Go to `Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions`, and click `New Repository secret`
  8. Use `JWT_TOKEN` and paste your JWT Token from Steps 3
  9. Go to your forked repository üç¥ and go to the Actions tab and press `I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to farm XP, go to the [`Manual lessons trigger`](https://github.com/gorouflex/DuoXPy/actions/workflows/manual.yml) workflows ( located in the Actions tab of the repo ). Then, enter the lesson you need to farm ( 1 lesson = 20xp ). Usually, if you enter a lot of lessons ( like >1000 ) or if Duolingo cannot handle the request, you will receive an error code or log, and the lesson will be skipped. So, think wisely before entering the lesson!
> 
> If you got `No skillId found in xpGains` log then try to do least 1 lesson so it can run back to normal!

## How to fix `Error 500 - No SkillID found in xpGains`?

- Do not let your latest study session empty, at least get them to level 1 like these images below by completing 1 lesson or some lessons ( applied for every single course like English, Spanish, Japanese, etc... )

## How to change the schedule that the workflows will run?

> [!IMPORTANT]
Daily workflow file path ( default is 14:00 UTC ¬± 0, and **DO NOT** enter your token here cause it will **not work** and may leak your information to everyone ): `.github/workflows/daily.yml`

- Well, GitHub uses UTC time ( UTC ¬± 0 ) for scheduling workflows, so we should convert it to our timezone

- For example: If I want to set the daily trigger to trigger at 9:00 PM ( UTC + 7 ) , I have to set it to 2:00 PM or 14:00 ( 24-hour format ) ( UTC ¬± 0 ) ( 2+7=9 ):

```
name: Daily lessons
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 14 * * *' # <- Use UTC Time +0 , change your time here ( 14 is hour , 0 is minutes ) and use 24-hour format
```
- So, if I want the daily trigger to run at 5:00 AM ( UTC + 7 ), I have to set it to 10:00 PM ( UTC ¬± 0 ) ( use 24-hour format ):

```
name: Daily lessons
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 22 * * *' # <- Use UTC Time +0 , change your time here ( 14 is hour , 0 is minutes ) and use 24-hour format
```


> [!NOTE]
> GitHub Actions schedules can sometimes be delayed by up to 15 minutes due to high demand, so don‚Äôt worry! ‚è±Ô∏è

# Config

- Usually, you can find your config folder in the same place as the `main.py` file. In some specific cases, you might need to locate your config through the information window in the `main.py` file
- You can change your information and lessons in the config file
