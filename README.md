## How to change the schedule that the workflows will run?

> [!IMPORTANT]
Daily workflow file path ( default is 14:00 UTC ¬± 0, and **DO NOT** enter your token here cause it will **not work** and may leak your information to everyone ): `.github/workflows/daily.yml`

- Well, GitHub uses UTC time ( UTC ¬± 0 ) for scheduling workflows, so we should convert it to our timezone

- For example: If I want to set the daily trigger to trigger at 9:00 PM ( UTC + 7 ) , I have to set it to 2:00 PM or 14:00 ( 24-hour format ) ( UTC ¬± 0 ) ( 2+7=9 ):

```
name: Daily Release Detector
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 14 * * *' # <- Use UTC Time +0 , change your time here ( 14 is hour , 0 is minutes ) and use 24-hour format
```
- So, if I want the daily trigger to run at 5:00 AM ( UTC + 7 ), I have to set it to 10:00 PM ( UTC ¬± 0 ) ( use 24-hour format ):

```
name: Daily Release Detector
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 22 * * *' # <- Use UTC Time +0 , change your time here ( 14 is hour , 0 is minutes ) and use 24-hour format
```


> [!NOTE]
> GitHub Actions schedules can sometimes be delayed by up to 15 minutes due to high demand, so don‚Äôt worry! ‚è±Ô∏è
